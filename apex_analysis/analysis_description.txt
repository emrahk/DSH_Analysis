This document describes the analysis steps and codes (with how they are called) to analyze the apex data together with the Chandra data.

Codes:

1.
fitcoprofile_apex, infile, outpar, ps=ps, fname=namef

This program fits and plots CO J=1-0 (or any given) map with multiple gausses
saves important results like integrated velocities and near and far distances

OUTPUT
outpar: structure that holds information on gauss profiles, integrated profiles, and near and far distances

dependencies
uses gaussfits.pro which compiles gauss_fits.pro, and uses gauss_fx.pro

EXAMPLE

figures/apex_gauss.eps

Problems, to be checked again:
MC 73-74 complex, MC 73 tiny
60-70 empty, but it is an important region.
Ask how the integrated velocity curves are obtained....
Compare with Maria s results given in lines_list_v2.txt and spec2.png

2.
plot_combimage, inpfits, vrange, outim, ps=ps, fname=namef, $
                    useavg=useavg, maxscl=sclmax

; This program reads an image cube fits file and then plots a combined
; image with the given velocity range

; OUTPUTS
;
; outim: combined image

EXAMPLE:

inpfits='apex_cubes/4U1630_12CO.fits'
plot_combimage,inpfits, [-90.,-75], outim,/useavg

plots are created as sum (not using /useavg):

figures/comb_75_90.eps

Problems, to be checked again:
To enlarge figure a rebinning is performed, and there are magic numbers in it. scaling is a little arbitrary. A pure non-rebinned version without magic numbers should be written for a proper analysis.

3.
function ang_analysis, inpimg, cdelt, rin, rout, theta, del_theta, $
                       offset=setoff, plot=plot, ps=ps, fname=namef

; This program calculates the brightness of a wedge with inner radius
; rin, outer radius rout from the given center, theta-del_theta/2 to
;  theta+del_theta/2 where theta is the angle from the x axis.

OUTPUTS
;
; returns sum of pixels in the wedge

EXAMPLE:

outim: output of plot_combimage
ang_analysis(outim, cdelt, 90., 170., 345, 30, /plot)

results: images not saved. Still developing.

Problems, to be checked again:
1. Magic numbers, still specific to apex - must be used for Chandra as well
2. Cannot handle negative angles well
3. boundary angles (0, 180) etc seems problematic

TODO:

1. fix combimage to produce bare 28x28 avg or sum images with no rebinning.
2. Fix angular_analysis magic numbers and bugs
3. apply to non-rebinned combimage results
4. expand (or use as base) to write a similar code for the Chandra analysis.
