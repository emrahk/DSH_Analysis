This document describes the analysis steps and codes (with how they are called) to analyze the apex data together with the Chandra data.

Codes:

fitcoprofile_apex, infile, outpar, ps=ps, fname=namef

This program fits and plots CO J=1-0 (or any given) map with multiple gausses
saves important results like integrated velocities and near and far distances

OUTPUT
outpar: structure that holds information on gauss profiles, integrated profiles, and near and far distances

dependencies
uses gaussfits.pro which compiles gauss_fits.pro, and uses gauss_fx.pro

EXAMPLE


Problems, to be checked again:
MC 73-74 complex, MC 73 tiny
60-70 empty, but it is an important region.
Ask how the integrated velocity curves are obtained....
